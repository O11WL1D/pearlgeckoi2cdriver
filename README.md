# Description:


This is the cumulative product of my embedded software class. This driver communicates with the peal geckoâ€™s onboard humidity sensor via the i2c protocol. The following features are implemented in said driver:
-Sleep module which runs pearl gecko in lowest energy mode for any given task
-Scheduler which handles interrupts via callbacks
-Software state machine
-Usage of onboard timers
-Usage of GPIO ports
